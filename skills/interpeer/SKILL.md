# Interpeer: Cross-AI Peer Review

## Purpose

Get expert technical feedback from OpenAI Codex CLI and collaboratively review it with the user. This provides a "second pair of eyes" on:
- Technical design documents
- Implementation approaches
- Code architecture
- System designs
- Code quality and best practices

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when:**
- You've completed a design document and want expert validation
- You're unsure about a technical approach and want a second opinion
- You want to validate architectural decisions before implementation
- The user asks for external review of work
- You want to catch potential issues early

**Examples:**
- "Can you get Codex feedback on this design doc?"
- "Let's validate this approach with Codex"
- "I want a second opinion on this architecture"
- After completing a design: proactively offer "Would you like me to get Codex feedback on this design?"

## TL;DR

**The entire workflow in 30 seconds:**

1. **Install**: Ensure [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex-cli) is installed
2. **Run**: `codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review FILE focusing on X, Y, Z. START NOW."`
3. **Discuss**: Present Codex's feedback to user, analyze together, make informed decisions

**Time**: 1-3 minutes for most reviews
**Timeout**: Optional safety feature - add if you have it, skip if you don't
**Key principle**: Codex is an expert consultant, not an authority. You and the user make final decisions.

## Quick Start

**Simplest review (1-2 minutes):**

```bash
codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review the file: path/to/file.md

Focus on: architecture, performance, security

Provide:
- Top 3 strengths
- Top 3 concerns
- Top 3 recommendations

TIME BUDGET: 2 minutes maximum
START RESPONSE NOW."
```

**That's it!** Codex will:
1. Read the file you specified
2. Analyze it based on your focus areas
3. Return structured feedback in ~1-2 minutes

The `TIME BUDGET` in the prompt is usually enough to keep reviews fast.

**Want extra safety?** Add a timeout command to force-kill if Codex runs too long:

```bash
# If you have 'timeout' installed (Linux, most systems):
timeout 180 codex exec --sandbox read-only "..."

# If you have 'gtimeout' installed (macOS with Homebrew coreutils):
gtimeout 180 codex exec --sandbox read-only "..."
```

This is **optional** - skip it if you don't have timeout installed. See [Advanced: Installing Timeout](#installing-timeout) if you want to add this extra safety layer.

### Note for Claude Code Agents

When using this skill, auto-detect the timeout command once at the start:

```bash
# Detect timeout (run once per session)
if command -v gtimeout >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    TIMEOUT_CMD="gtimeout 180"
elif command -v timeout >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    TIMEOUT_CMD="timeout 180"
else
    TIMEOUT_CMD=""  # No timeout available, rely on TIME BUDGET in prompt
fi
```

Then use `$TIMEOUT_CMD` in your commands:

```bash
$TIMEOUT_CMD codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review FILE..."
```

If `TIMEOUT_CMD` is empty, the command still works - you're just relying on the TIME BUDGET prompt constraint instead of a hard timeout.

## Choosing Your Review Mode

**Decision tree for picking the right approach:**

```
What are you reviewing?
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Single file, obvious focus (e.g., "review for security")
‚îÇ  ‚Üí Use: Quick Command (30 seconds)
‚îÇ  ‚Üí Skip: AskUserQuestion phase
‚îÇ  ‚Üí Example: codex exec "Review FILE focusing on security..."
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Single file, need to ask user what to focus on
‚îÇ  ‚Üí Use: Interactive Workflow (3-5 minutes)
‚îÇ  ‚Üí Include: Phase 1 (AskUserQuestion) for focus areas
‚îÇ  ‚Üí Then: Run Codex with selected focus
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Multiple related files (2-5 files)
‚îÇ  ‚Üí Use: Multi-file command
‚îÇ  ‚Üí Example: codex exec "Review files: file1.ts, file2.ts, file3.ts..."
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Abstract concept (no file exists)
‚îÇ  ‚Üí Use: Concept review (see Advanced)
‚îÇ  ‚Üí Need to embed description in prompt
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ Complex project (>5 files, unclear scope)
   ‚Üí Use: Comprehensive mode (see Advanced)
   ‚Üí May need multiple focused review calls
```

**Default: Start with Quick Command.** Only use full workflow when you need user interaction to determine focus.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Prepare for Review (Optional - skip if focus is clear)

**1. Identify the Review Target**

Determine what needs review:
- Specific file path (e.g., `docs/technical/design.md`)
- Code implementation (e.g., `src/auth/handler.ts`)
- Multiple related files
- Abstract concept (no file)

**2. Ask User for Review Scope (when focus is unclear)**

**Note for manual users:** If you're running `codex exec` commands yourself (not using Claude Code), just decide on your focus areas (e.g., "security, performance") and skip to Phase 2. This step is for Claude Code agents.

**If you're Claude Code using this skill:** Use the AskUserQuestion tool to let users select focus areas:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What aspects should Codex review?",
    "header": "Review Focus",
    "multiSelect": true,
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "Architecture & Design",
        "description": "Component structure, design patterns, separation of concerns"
      },
      {
        "label": "Performance",
        "description": "Bottlenecks, optimization opportunities, scalability"
      },
      {
        "label": "Security",
        "description": "Vulnerabilities, input validation, authentication/authorization"
      },
      {
        "label": "Best Practices",
        "description": "Code quality, maintainability, language-specific patterns"
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

**When to skip this phase:**
- User already specified focus ("review this for security")
- Obvious focus based on context (e.g., performance optimization PR)
- Quick validation where general feedback is fine
- Running commands manually (just pick your own focus areas)

### Phase 2: Call Codex CLI

**Default: Single File Review**

```bash
codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review the file: path/to/file.md

TIME BUDGET: 2 minutes maximum
OUTPUT REQUIRED: Start response immediately

Focus on: [aspects from Phase 1 or user request]

Provide:
## Strengths
- [strength 1]
- [strength 2]

## Critical Concerns
- [concern 1] - Severity: [High/Medium/Low]
- [concern 2] - Severity: [High/Medium/Low]

## Recommendations
1. [recommendation 1]
2. [recommendation 2]

START RESPONSE NOW."
```

**Multi-File Review (2-5 files)**

```bash
codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review these files:
- path/to/file1.ts
- path/to/file2.ts
- path/to/file3.ts

TIME BUDGET: 3 minutes maximum
OUTPUT REQUIRED: Start response immediately

Focus on: [aspects]

For each file, provide:
- Key findings
- Cross-file issues or inconsistencies

START RESPONSE NOW."
```

**Common Patterns**

| Review Type | Command Template |
|------------|------------------|
| **Security Review** | `codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review FILE for security. Check: input validation, auth, injection risks. TIME BUDGET: 2 min. START NOW."` |
| **Performance Review** | `codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review FILE for performance. Check: bottlenecks, N+1 queries, memory usage. TIME BUDGET: 2 min. START NOW."` |
| **Code Quality** | `codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review FILE for best practices. Check: maintainability, error handling, patterns. TIME BUDGET: 2 min. START NOW."` |
| **Architecture** | `codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review FILE for architecture. Check: separation of concerns, coupling, scalability. TIME BUDGET: 2 min. START NOW."` |

**With Timeout (Optional)**

For extra safety, prefix commands with your detected `$TIMEOUT_CMD`:

```bash
$TIMEOUT_CMD codex exec --sandbox read-only "..."
```

This force-kills Codex after 3 minutes if it runs too long. Skip if you don't have timeout installed.

### Phase 3: Present Feedback to User

**Use this template for presenting feedback:**

```markdown
# Interpeer Review: [File/Project Name]

## Executive Summary

[Codex's 2-3 sentence overall assessment]

## Strengths ‚úÖ

- [Strength 1 with file:line reference if available]
- [Strength 2]
- [Strength 3]

## Concerns ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Critical
[Issues that must be addressed - bugs, security, performance blockers]

- **[Finding name]** ([file:line])
  - [Description]
  - Impact: [explain severity]

### Important
[Should be addressed - architecture, maintainability, scalability]

- **[Finding name]** ([file:line])
  - [Description]

### Minor
[Nice-to-have improvements]

- [Suggestion 1]

## Recommendations üí°

### 1. [Top Priority Recommendation]

**Codex's recommendation:** "[Direct quote from Codex]"

**My analysis:** [Your interpretation with project context]

**Impact if addressed:** [What improves]

**Your take?** [Question to user]

### 2. [Second Priority]

**Codex's recommendation:** "[Quote]"

**My analysis:** [Your take]

**Trade-offs:** [Pros/cons of implementing]

### 3. [Third Priority]

**Codex's recommendation:** "[Quote]"

**My analysis:** [Your take]

## Discussion

What do you think about these findings? Should we:
- [Specific action 1 based on feedback]
- [Specific action 2]
- [Alternative approach 3]

Which would you like to tackle first?
```

**Key principles:**
- Start with Codex's executive summary verbatim
- Organize concerns by severity (Critical/Important/Minor)
- For each recommendation, provide BOTH Codex's view AND your analysis
- Always include file:line references when available
- Ask specific questions to guide discussion
- Propose concrete next steps

### Phase 4: Collaborative Review

**Discuss each point with the user:**

For each piece of feedback:

1. **Present the feedback point**
   ```
   Codex raised this concern: "[feedback quote]"
   ```

2. **Provide your analysis**
   ```
   I think this is [valid/questionable/contextual] because [reasoning]
   ```

3. **Ask user for input**
   ```
   What do you think about this feedback? Should we:
   - Address it now
   - Note it for later
   - Disagree and explain why
   ```

4. **Discuss implications**
   - How would addressing this change the design?
   - What's the trade-off?
   - Is it worth the complexity?

### Phase 5: Action Planning

**After reviewing all feedback:**

```
Based on Codex's feedback and our discussion, here's what I recommend:

Immediate Changes:
1. [Critical fix 1]
2. [Critical fix 2]

Future Enhancements:
1. [Nice to have 1]
2. [Nice to have 2]

Disagreements (with reasoning):
1. [Feedback we decided not to follow and why]

Would you like me to:
- Update the design document with these changes?
- Create a task list for addressing the feedback?
- Implement the critical changes now?
```

## Advanced Scenarios

### Conceptual/Abstract Reviews (No File)

When reviewing an approach or concept that doesn't exist as a file:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | codex exec --sandbox read-only -
Review this technical approach:

## Context
[Background and constraints]

## Proposed Solution
[Your approach]

## Alternatives Considered
[Other options]

## Questions
[Specific questions for review]

TIME BUDGET: 2 minutes
OUTPUT REQUIRED: Start immediately with trade-offs and recommendations
START RESPONSE NOW.
EOF
```

### Complex Projects (>5 files)

For large reviews, use focused multiple calls rather than one comprehensive call:

**Phase 1: Architecture Overview (2 min)**
```bash
codex exec --sandbox read-only "Quick architecture scan of:
- src/main.rs
- src/lib.rs
- src/config.rs

TIME BUDGET: 2 minutes
Provide: Top 3 architectural strengths, top 3 concerns
START NOW."
```

**Phase 2: Deep Dive on Concerns (3 min, only if Phase 1 found issues)**
```bash
codex exec --sandbox read-only "Deep dive on [specific concern from Phase 1].

Focus on file: [file identified in Phase 1]

TIME BUDGET: 3 minutes
Provide: Root cause, location, fix recommendation
START NOW."
```

### Installing Timeout

**Linux/WSL:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install coreutils

# Already included in most distributions
timeout --version  # Check if already installed
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Install Homebrew if needed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install coreutils for gtimeout
brew install coreutils

# Verify
gtimeout --version
```

**Windows:**
- Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and follow Linux instructions
- Or use Git Bash with timeout binary
- Or skip timeout (Codex will still work, just no time limit)

### Monitoring for Analysis Loops

**Signs Codex is stuck (rare with simple commands):**
- No output after 2-3 minutes
- Multiple "thinking" blocks without findings
- Repeated file reads (if visible in stderr)

**Recovery:**
```bash
# Kill the process
pkill -f "codex exec"

# Or Ctrl+C if running in foreground

# Restart with narrower scope
codex exec --sandbox read-only "Quick review of FILE.
Focus only on: [one specific aspect]
TIME: 1 minute
START NOW."
```

## Critical Review Principles

### 1. Codex as Expert Consultant, Not Authority

**Remember:**
- Codex provides valuable input but doesn't know your full context
- You and the user make the final decisions
- Some feedback may not apply to your specific use case

**Pattern:**
```
Codex suggests: [feedback]

My analysis: [your interpretation with context]

Recommendation: [what you think should be done and why]

What do you think?
```

### 2. Balance Feedback with Project Constraints

**Consider:**
- Performance requirements
- Existing architecture decisions
- Project scope (YAGNI vs future-proofing)
- Team expertise and maintainability

**Pattern:**
```
Codex recommends [X], which would improve [Y].

However, given our constraints:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

I suggest [modified approach] instead because [reasoning].
```

### 3. Separate Categories of Feedback

**Critical (Must Address):**
- Correctness issues (bugs, logic errors)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance blockers
- Data loss risks

**Important (Should Address):**
- Architectural improvements
- Maintainability concerns
- Missing error handling
- Scalability issues

**Nice-to-Have (Consider):**
- Code style suggestions
- Alternative approaches
- Future optimizations
- Documentation improvements

## Example Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quick File Review

```
User: "Can you get Codex feedback on the auth handler?"

You:
1. codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review src/auth/handler.ts
   Focus: security, error handling
   TIME BUDGET: 2 min
   START NOW."
2. Present feedback using template
3. Discuss findings with user
4. Update code if needed
```

### Pattern 2: Design Document with User Input

```
User: "Review the agent system design"

You:
1. Use AskUserQuestion to get focus areas
2. codex exec with selected focus areas
3. Present organized feedback
4. Discuss each recommendation
5. Update design document with agreed changes
```

### Pattern 3: Pre-Implementation Validation

```
After completing design:

You: "I've completed the design. Would you like me to get Codex feedback before implementation?"

User: "Yes"

You:
1. Quick review: codex exec with architecture/performance focus
2. Present findings
3. Discuss and resolve concerns
4. Update design if needed
5. Proceed to implementation with validated design
```

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- Start with simple commands, add complexity only when needed
- Always provide your own analysis alongside Codex feedback
- Organize feedback by priority/severity
- Discuss trade-offs for each suggestion
- Make final decisions collaboratively
- Use timeout when available for safety

**DON'T:**
- Blindly implement all Codex suggestions without discussion
- Present feedback without context or analysis
- Skip discussing feedback that seems wrong
- Assume Codex knows your project constraints
- Use Codex as the sole decision-maker
- Over-complicate the review process

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Standard file review
codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review FILE focusing on ASPECTS. TIME: 2 min. START NOW."

# With timeout (optional - use $TIMEOUT_CMD from detection)
$TIMEOUT_CMD codex exec --sandbox read-only "..."

# Multi-file
codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review files: FILE1, FILE2, FILE3 focusing on ASPECTS. TIME: 3 min. START NOW."

# Security focused
codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review FILE for security vulnerabilities. Check: injection, auth, validation. TIME: 2 min. START NOW."

# Performance focused
codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review FILE for performance issues. Check: bottlenecks, memory, algorithms. TIME: 2 min. START NOW."

# Architecture focused
codex exec --sandbox read-only "Review FILE for architecture. Check: coupling, patterns, scalability. TIME: 2 min. START NOW."
```

## Remember

This skill is about **collaborative review**, not automated acceptance:
1. Get Codex's expert perspective
2. Add your contextual analysis
3. Discuss with user
4. Make informed decisions together
5. Document reasoning for accepted/rejected feedback

The goal is **better decisions through multiple perspectives**, not replacing human judgment.
