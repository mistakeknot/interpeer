The implementation includes:\n\n1. **Multi-agent routing functionality** in `tools/interpeer-mcp/src/index.ts:213-226` with the `routeReview()` function\n2. **Target agent parameter support** via the `target_agent` field in the Zod schema (lines 64-67)\n3. **Three agent adapters implemented**:\n   - Claude Code adapter (`runClaudeCodeReview()` at lines 228-272)\n   - Codex CLI adapter (`runCodexReview()` at lines 274-317) \n   - Factory CLI adapter (`runFactoryReview()` at lines 319-337)\n4. **CLI availability checks** via individual functions (`ensureClaudeCliAvailable()`, `ensureCodexCliAvailable()`, `ensureFactoryCliAvailable()`)\n5. **Shared prompt builder** (`buildClaudePrompts()` at lines 411-449) used by Claude Code and Codex CLI\n6. **Cross-agent prompt builder** (`buildCrossAgentPrompt()` at lines 451-463) for Factory CLI\n7. **Metadata reporting** with usage token tracking and agent information in the response metadata\n8. **Helper utilities** including CLI command execution (`runCliCommand()`), setting source parsing (`parseSettingSources()`), and extra args parsing (`parseExtraArgs()`)\n\nThe implementation uses the AI SDK with provider packages for Claude Code and Codex CLI integration, and direct CLI command execution for Factory CLI. All responses are normalized through the `AgentReviewResult` interface with consistent metadata structure.\n\nSuccessfully implemented multi-agent routing with target_agent parameter, three distinct agent adapters (Claude Code via ai-sdk-provider-claude-code, Codex CLI via ai-sdk-provider-codex-cli, Factory CLI via direct command execution), CLI availability validation functions, shared prompt builders for consistent formatting across agents, comprehensive usage metadata collection and reporting, and utility functions for configuration parsing and command execution. All agent responses normalized through AgentReviewResult interface ensuring consistent metadata structure and error handling.\n</info added on 2025-10-25T03:01:16.472Z>",
